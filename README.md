# skins-remover

Are you annoyed at people that constantly type !knife/!gloves/!ws in chat?

We (I mean communism) have a perfect solution! Just complile this plugin drop it in your plugins folder and see people being removed. It is so simple! (For now plugin kicks people if they try to use the command. We are planning to intergrate it with [SourceBans](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp))

WARNING! Plugin requires [MetaMod](https://github.com/alliedmodders/metamod-source) and [Sourcemod](https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcemod)
